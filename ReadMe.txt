General Info:

This is the MagMutual Take Home Project, coded by Aleks Belotserkovskaya.

____________________________________________________________________

Goals:

1. Build Microservice that exposes endpoints to return the following info:

- Endpoint to return a specific user + all associated user information.
- Endpoint to return a list of users created between a date range.
- Endpoint to return a list of users based on a specific profession.
- Custom Endpoint (I chose to return a list of users from a specific country).

2. Read the given CSV file as input.

3. Build a simple UI to display the information.

____________________________________________________________________

Assumptions:

You can build it in any language/framework combination.

____________________________________________________________________

Deliverables:

- Source code.
- Answers to project questions.

____________________________________________________________________

Technologies:

A list of technologies used within the project:

- Java (backend logic + mapping endpoints)
- Spring Framework (created a Spring Boot application)
- HTML (very basic UI)
- thymeleaf (Java XML/XHTML/HTML5 template engine)
- JUnit + Jupiter for Unit Tests
- GitHub for version control. 
- Maven for dependency management. 

____________________________________________________________________

Running the Application:

cd into the project's root directory in terminal 
and run the following command: 

./mvnw spring-boot:run

Answers to Project Questions:

1. What did you think of the project?

The project was a good exercise in building a small web application from the ground up. 
It was a manageable amount of work for the given timeline. 

There are definitely some changes and updates I would implement if given more time to work on it, 
but those will be outlined in the below answers. 

2. What didnâ€™t you like about the project?

There was not a set rubric or way of knowing if I am meeting the project criteria, 
other than the basic list of deliverables. 

Otherwise, the project was pretty similar to the type of work I am used to doing day-to-day, 
so not an unreasonable ask. 

3. How would you change the project or approach?
____________________________________________________________________

Future Changes / Additions to my Approach:

Most of what I would change about my approach would just be cleaning up and making the code more scalable. 

With the given timeline, I did not have time to successfully pull the list of countries and list of professions 
for the dropdown menus, so instead, I had to hardcode those select options, which of course is not ideal. 
In the long run, I would instead make this info based off of the CSV file data, so that the options can change if needed. 

Other than making more of the data dynamic instead of hardcoded, 
I would add more input validation and error / exception management. 
For example, I would want to check for errors in input and allow for a wider range of CSV files as input, 
rather than assuming that certain columns hold specific data. 
I would also want to make inputting multiple CSV files an option.

____________________________________________________________________

Data Storage: 

In terms of data storage, once the data is read into the StoreUserData class, 
it is then held in a mix of ArrayLists and HashMaps. 
If this program were to be used in the long run, I would definitely replace that structure 
with use of a database that could be queried for this same information. 

____________________________________________________________________

Testing: 

I created some JUnit tests but did not flesh them out as in-depth as I wanted to. 
Given more time, I would go more into detail with these tests and check all possible edge cases. 

____________________________________________________________________

User Interface: 

Finally, I would definitely make the UI look better - I did not use CSS or much Javascript here 
since the project asked for a simple UI. I just focused on the logic and making sure the endpoints worked as expected. 

____________________________________________________________________

4. Anything else you would like to share?

More thoughts / Summary:

Ideas for additional endpoints, verification and error messages: 

- Check for and have Error Handling for incorrect city/country combinations in CSV file. 
- Allow for user to input csv file + check for incorrect columns or data or format.
- Check for users / countries / id's with similar spelling to allow for slight misspellings. 
- Add endpoints to mix search options, such as searching for users by profession AND country simultaneously. 
	
Ideas for improving UI: 
 
- Add more buttons to screen for ease of usability. 
- Add CSS to make it easier to use and more aesthetically pleasing. 
	
Ideas for additional functionality:

- Maybe when a list appears, a user could click button next to each listed user to see their full info. 
	
Overall future TO DO's: 

- Change drop downs to not be static and instead pull info from CSV file (for countries + professions dropdowns). 
- Add database storage instead of storing data temporarily inside of the StoreUserData class.
